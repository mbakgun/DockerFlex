# DockerFlex Features

## Security & Authentication

DockerFlex provides robust security features centered around a flexible master password protection system. When enabled through the `MASTER_PASSWORD` environment variable, all container operations and API endpoints require authentication. The session-based system maintains user authentication until the browser tab is closed, providing a balance between security and convenience. 

For container-level security, DockerFlex implements privileged mode operations with careful permission management. The system utilizes Docker socket volume mounting with secure permissions and includes essential capability additions like SYS_ADMIN and DAC_READ_SEARCH to ensure proper functionality while maintaining security standards.

## Responsive Design & Mobile Support

The interface is built from the ground up with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across all device sizes. On mobile devices, the application transforms to provide touch-friendly controls, collapsible menus, and optimized toolbars. The file browser and editor components adapt intelligently to smaller screens, maintaining functionality without compromising usability.

Navigation on mobile devices is streamlined through simplified menus and touch-optimized controls. The breadcrumb navigation system adjusts dynamically to screen size, ensuring users can always track their location within the container file system. Search dialogs and operation menus are specifically designed to be thumb-friendly on mobile devices.

## Advanced File Management

At its core, DockerFlex excels in file operations with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Users can effortlessly create, upload, download, rename, and delete files and folders. The system supports space characters in file names and provides automatic naming for copy operations. The drag-and-drop functionality includes visual feedback during operations and supports moving files between directories, including parent directory operations.

Multiple file selection enables batch operations, while directory-specific drop zones make it clear where files will be placed. The system provides progress indicators for all operations and handles errors gracefully with clear user feedback.

## Professional Code Editor

The built-in code editor is powered by CodeMirror, offering comprehensive syntax highlighting for a wide range of languages including JavaScript, Python, PHP, SQL, HTML/CSS, XML, YAML, JSON, Markdown, Shell scripts, Go, and configuration formats like NGINX and TOML. Real-time code linting helps catch errors as you type, particularly useful for JSON and YAML files.

The editor features a custom-designed dark theme optimized for extended coding sessions, with features like line numbers, active line highlighting, and multiple cursor support. Advanced capabilities include auto-completion, bracket matching, code folding, and rectangle selection. The editor maintains editing history and provides comprehensive search and replace functionality.

## Search & Navigation Features

File management is enhanced by powerful search capabilities that work in real-time. The system supports case-insensitive searching and file type filtering, making it easy to locate specific files within containers. The search interface is optimized for both desktop and mobile use, allowing quick filtering within the current directory.

Container navigation is streamlined through status indicators and quick access to container details. Real-time status updates keep users informed of container state changes, while the breadcrumb navigation system provides clear context of the current location within the file system.

## User Interface & Experience

The interface is built on Material-UI components with a focus on dark mode optimization. The consistent color scheme and high-contrast design ensure excellent readability and reduce eye strain during extended use. The system provides comprehensive feedback through notifications, loading indicators, and status updates for all operations.

Accessibility is a key focus, with support for keyboard navigation, screen readers, and clear visual hierarchies. The interface uses intuitive icons and maintains consistent focus management for improved usability.

## Container Management

DockerFlex provides comprehensive container management features, allowing users to view and monitor all Docker containers in real-time. Each container displays detailed information including name, status, image details, and network configuration. Users can quickly access container files and restart containers when needed.

The system maintains real-time status updates for all containers, ensuring users always have current information about their container environment. Container operations are handled securely with appropriate permission levels.

## Technical Infrastructure

The application is built on a robust technical foundation that prioritizes performance through optimized file operations, efficient state management, and strategic component lazy loading. The frontend minimizes re-renders and implements content caching where appropriate.

Network operations are handled through a secure proxy configuration with CORS support, ensuring reliable communication between frontend and backend components. The system includes WebSocket support for real-time updates and comprehensive error handling for network operations.

## Configuration & Deployment

DockerFlex offers flexible configuration through environment variables, allowing customization of API endpoints, backend URLs, ports, and security settings. The development environment supports hot module replacement and includes comprehensive development tools.

Docker deployment is streamlined through custom network configuration options, volume mounting capabilities, and flexible port mapping. The system supports various restart policies and container naming conventions, making it adaptable to different deployment scenarios.
